# Dynamic Programming (DP)

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is used when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems which can be solved independently and then combined to give the solution to the original problem.

## Key Concepts

### Optimal Substructure
A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems. In other words, if you can solve the problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem, it is suitable for DP.

### Overlapping Subproblems
A problem has overlapping subproblems if the same subproblems are solved multiple times. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the result, DP avoids the redundant work that occurs in naive recursive solutions.

### Memoization
Memoization is a technique used in DP to store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again. It is typically implemented using a cache or table.

### Tabulation
Tabulation is another technique used in DP that involves solving the problem by filling up a table in a bottom-up manner. It starts from the simplest subproblems and builds up to the solution of the overall problem.

## Applications

Dynamic Programming is widely used in various fields such as:

- **Operations Research:** Solving optimization problems.
- **Bioinformatics:** Sequence alignment and genetic analysis.
- **Finance:** Portfolio optimization and risk management.
- **Computer Graphics:** Pathfinding and image processing.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Game theory and decision making.

DP is a powerful technique that can significantly reduce the complexity of problems that involve overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
