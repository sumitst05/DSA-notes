# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make a sequence of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, with the hope that these local optimal choices will lead to a globally optimal solution. Greedy algorithms are often used when the problem can be broken down into a series of choices and the choice of each step is independent of the future steps.

## Key Concepts

### Greedy Choice Property
A problem exhibits the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by selecting a locally optimal choice at each step. This means that a greedy choice at each step will lead to an optimal solution.

### Optimal Substructure
A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems. This property allows a problem to be solved efficiently using a greedy approach if the problem can be decomposed into subproblems with optimal solutions.

## Applications

Greedy algorithms are useful in various applications such as:

- **Network Design:** Finding the minimum spanning tree for efficient network construction.
- **Compression:** Building optimal prefix codes for data compression.
- **Scheduling:** Solving scheduling problems with constraints.
- **Routing:** Finding shortest paths in networking and transportation.

Greedy algorithms are particularly effective for problems where local optimization leads to a global solution. However, they may not always produce an optimal solution for all problems, so their applicability depends on the problem structure.
