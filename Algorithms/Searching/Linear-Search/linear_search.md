# Linear Search

- Linear search sequentially checks each element of the list / array until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached. It is also known as a sequential search.

---

### Algorithm:
- Start at the beginning of the list / array.
- Compare each element with the target element.
- If the target element is found, return the index of the element.
- If the end of the list is reached without finding the target, indicate that the target is not present in the list / array.

### Characteristics:
**Unsorted Data**: Linear search does not require the list to be sorted. It can be applied to both sorted and unsorted lists.

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement.
- **No Sorting Required**: It works with both sorted and unsorted data.
- **No Additional Memory**: It does not require additional memory allocation for data structures.

### Disadvantages:
- **Inefficiency for Large Lists**: For large lists, linear search can be slow compared to other search algorithms like binary search.
