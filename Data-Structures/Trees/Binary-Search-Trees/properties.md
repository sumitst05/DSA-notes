# Properties of Binary Search Trees

#### 1. Binary Tree Structure:

Each node in a BST has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child just like in a binary tree.

#### 2. Value Ordering:

For each node, 
- All nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value 
- All nodes in its right subtree have values more than the node's value

This ordering property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. The key advantage of a BST is that it provides logarithmic time complexity for these operations on average.
